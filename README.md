# ProjectKatie
on GitHub using Pycharm

## Purpose:
This project repository is being used to learn about project file collaboration using PyCharm and GitHub

### Notes:
This README.md file is "know" as a "MarkDown" file type (hence the .md extension)
What this means is that it is automaticaly recognized as a file that displays like a simple HTML page.
This makes it very easy to produce reasonable well formatted text files for Documentation (and other similiar) purposes
